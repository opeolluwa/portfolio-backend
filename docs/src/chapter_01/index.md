## What is Raccoon?
Raccoon is an enterprise-scale Identity and Access Management Service for Microservices

The solution is implemented with [the Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) a memory-safe systems programming language for building fast and secure applications. The application also integrates with the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
  database which is optimized for fast read and write database operations

  As of this stage of development, the project uses [sqlx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) to interact with databases.  However, the project hope to ship with [xorm](https://github.com/opeolluwa/xorm) which is an async-first ORM library for Rust which make using ORM very simplistic

  ## Why Raccoon? 
 There is an ever-growing need to build a fast, secure, and battle-tested authentication and authorization server especially for user-facing [Software As A Service](https://www.oracle.com/ng/applications/what-is-saas/) products and e-commerce web and mobile application.

 Raccoon is a battery-included service which you can _plug-and-paly_ in your server with minimal configuration.
